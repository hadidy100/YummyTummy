Created a folder named as database, and created a script file with a .sql extenstion that creates the database for mySQL and creates 2 tables for the images and their descriptions. 
One table has the images as a blob data type, where php will interact with this table to retreive the images that are stored in it, and the other table has the description of the image where it has a foreign key to link it to the table that stors the images. 

The description table, contains text of 120 characters to describe what the image is all about. 

Modification to the tables columns are welcom and possible!! 

More to come!
